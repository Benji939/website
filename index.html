         <h2>Why This Hobby?</h2>
         <hr>
        <p> I enjoy solving them because, how could something so simple be so complicated? It's also very satisfying just putting all the colors in the correct spot, it's like the need for order. There are many variants of it, ones with more or less layers and some even with different shaps or different ways to turn. It so satisfying being your previous best time. Some may they think it will get old solving  it over and over again may get boring and old, for me it never does because there are more than 43 quintillion combinations and only one solution. </p>

          <a href="google-trends-rubiks-cube-term.png" target="_blank">  <p>If you click on this, t is approxiametly how many Rubik's Cubes were sold per year. And these are just Rubik's Brands!!! In total there are 350+ million Rubik's Cube brands have been sold, if you were to include other brands, or as some people call them, knockoffs, it would be far higher! It hit its peak around 2008, since then they've still been selling a lot but  it has decreased.</p> </a>
